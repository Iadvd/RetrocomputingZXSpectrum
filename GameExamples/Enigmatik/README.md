# Story
This is a puzzle / ability game / brain-teaser game. There are 4 demons unleashed inside Enigmatik, plus their master, named "The Question".

The four demons are: 

1) Pazuzu, Lord of the Winds. Location: the Maze. Seal: a red star. 
Wanted sacrifice: you have to guess it! 

2) Ningishzid, the Serpent God. Location: the Serpent temple. Seal: a green quadrifolium. Wanted sacrifice: you have to guess it!

3) Seshat, the Goddess of Calculations. Location: the Sudoku garden. Seal: a cyan diamond. Wanted sacrifice: you have to guess it! 

4) Heyoka, the Sacred Clown. Location: the Echo chamber. Symbol: a four sided magenta fractal. Wanted sacrifice: you have to guess it!

You need to recover the seals of the demons. Each time you make a sacrifice on each location, you win a part of a seal of that demon. When you obtain 10 seals, the demon is finally sealed. Be aware: winning a game in a location is not the same as obtaining a seal of a sacrifice.

# The Game
It is the mission of the player to discover what is the required sacrifice for each demon. Once you manage to seal the four demons, their master, The Question, will be summoned to you and a final event will happen. Good luck.

PD: oh, one more hint: every four games, if you have won three of them, a bonus game will start: if you win it, a random piece of a seal of one of the demons will be given to you for free.

# How to play the .tap file?

Just open the file "ENIGMATIK_ЭНИГМАТИК_FurilloProductions2020_Yandex_English.tap" (English ver.) or "ENIGMATIK_ЭНИГМАТИК_FurilloProductions2020_Yandex_Spanish.tap" (Spanish ver.) in your Spectrum emulator (mode 48K) and have fun! If you have a real Spectrum 48K or greater, and you have a .tap loading peripheral, you can load this game too! 

The controls are the whole keyboard... you will have to guess indeed!!! ;)
  
# For developers: How to compile/reuse the .tap file again? (not required to play the game)

1. In your Z88dk folder (e.g. C:\z88dk10) copy the contents of this folder. You should be using The Mojon Twins adapted version of the compiler (all credits to The Mojon Twins):

2. Use "make_with_loading_scr.bat enigmatik" command to create again the .tap file if you wish so.
